### Hey there! 👋

I'm Cengizhan, a Senior Software Engineer and Game Developer based in Turkey.

I have 10 years of full-stack development experience, but I am currently applying this background to game development.

**Tech Stack**
* **Game Dev:** Unity, C#
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and Angular
* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Python, Node.js, Django, REST APIs, and Firebase
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL
* **Tools:** Docker, Git, and Blender

I've successfully shipped products, but my favorites are Rush Out and Pixel Match.

If you want to see what I've built, my games are available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MadNomad)!
